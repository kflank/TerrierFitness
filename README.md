In our increasingly busy lives, everybody needs a way to stay healthy day in and day out. And with expensive personal trainers and misinformative influencers nowadays it is almost impossible to find the right workout, that was until Terrier Fitness. Terrier Fitness is a personal trainer and dietician all packed into one streamlined application right on your phone. The app allows users to customize specific workout plans for each day of the week. And for beginner fitness connoisseurs, the app will generate random exercises for a specific part of the body. The app also helps you track your BMI as well from height and weight to make sure you are keeping on top of your goals. Terrier Fitness, a coach in your pocket.

Terrier Fitness was created in the latest version of Xcode using Swift as its primary programming language. Swift is very streamlined and perfectly suited for creating ios applications efficiently. Apps developed with Swift require less time to install and less on-device memory, providing a better app experience for users. The UI of the app is created in the storyboard which breaks the views of the app into scenes which then can be correlated to swift files where action and outlets can be hard-coded. In these swift files, features like buttons, text fields, and labels can be programmed to connect with each other or with entirely different views. To run this app simply download the Fitness_App file from the main branch into your local Xcode environment. Finally, We did not take any code from Internet to build out code. We spend days learning the swift language and how different it was from c++. The code was build from scratch to demonstrate our enthusiasm for learning new languages.
